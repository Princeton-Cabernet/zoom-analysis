    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

### Run Unit Tests

    (cd build && make test)

### Applications

#### zoom_flows

Extracts packets associated with Zoom and prints per-flow statistics.
* reads all files in directory in lexicographical order of file names if *-i* is a directory path
* writes flow-level statistics to CSV if *-f* specified
* writes Zoom type statistics to CSV if *-t* specified
* writes Zoom-related packets to PCAP if *-p* specified
* generates time series of packet and byte rate in 1s buckets if *-r* specified
* writes records for Zoom packets to custom binary format if *-z* specified
* only considers/filters P2P and STUN packets if *-2* specified (flow summary will still include all flows)

```
usage: zoom_flows [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.pcap or IN/  input file/path
  -f, --flows-out OUT.csv  flow summary output file (optional)
  -t, --types-out OUT.csv  type summary output file (optional)
  -p, --pcap-out OUT.pcap  filtered pcap output file (optional)
  -r, --rate-out OUT.csv   rate time series output file (optional)
  -z, --zpkt-out OUT.zpkt  zoom packets binary output file (optional)
  -2, --p2p-only           only process STUN and P2P packets (optional)
  -h, --help               print this help message
```

#### zoom_rtp

Collects statistics about RTP streams in Zoom traffic.
* reads the *.zpkt* input file at the path specified by *-i*
* writes RTP-stream-level statistics to CSV if *-s* specified
* writes a detailed packet log to CSV if *-p* specified
* writes frames to CSV if *-f* specified
* writes performance-related statistics in 1s intervals to CSV if *-t* specified

```
usage: zoom_rtp [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.zpkt           input file
  -s, --streams-out OUT.csv  output path for stream summary (optional)
  -p, --pkts-out OUT.csv     output path for packet log (optional)
  -f, --frames-out OUT.csv   output path for frame log (optional)
  -t, --stats-out OUT.csv    output path for 1s statistics (optional)
  -h, --help                 print this help message
```

#### zoom_meetings

Groups packets by media streams and meetings.
* reads the *.zpkt* input file at the path specified by *-i*
* writes the set of unique (non-duplicate) media streams to CSV if *-u* specified
* writes meetings to CSV if *-m* specified

```
usage: zoom_meetings [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.zpkt                 input file name
  -u, --unique-out STREAMS.csv     unique streams out file name (optional)
  -m, --meetings-out MEETINGS.csv  meetings out file name (optional)
  -h, --help                       print this help message
```
